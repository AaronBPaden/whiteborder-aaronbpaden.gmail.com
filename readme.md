# White Border Overlay

## An extension for Gnome-Shell

This extension will create a white border around the display. This should allow Sinden Lightguns to work even if there isn't support for custom overlays in the application.


## WARNING

**Applications cannot bypass the compositor** while this extension is active. Native overlay support is still preferred.

Running games with compositing has input latency implications, will prevent VRR from activating and for modern, more demanding games the performance penalty may be prohibitive.

That said, this extension is useful for running standalone emulators like Supermodel and PCSX2, as well as older Windows applications in Wine like HOTD.
